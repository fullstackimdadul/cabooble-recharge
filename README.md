# Caboodle Shopify Store Recharge Subscription plan and Product variants Custom Js Source Code

With the custom code, we have merged single product's variations (used as subscription length) and Recharge Plan Selector into one selector. That means if we just select Subscription length (which is used as a variants), then the subscription plan selector will automatically selected. 

We have used Vanila Javascript ( Pure Raw Javascript ) for the solution.
